## Common Misconceptions
Students may have a limited understanding of how many aspects of their lives utilize coding and computer languages. They also might need some ‚Äòbuy-in‚Äô if they have not opted into the class. This is a chance to get them excited about how relevant coding is to their everyday lives and excited to learn!
